# News Site

The assignment was to create a news site with some articles and a navbar by using grid or flexbox. I decided to focus on flexbox, and I based my news site on Lego.

## The problem
Code is a whole new world for me, so I've had a hard time grasping it all. It's been a ride so to speak. I've had difficulties with the pictures, getting everything to fit and to be inline. I've tried and failed many times, and I'm not sure if I grasp it now either or understand it all, but I'm happy with the results as it is my first time. If I had more time I would try out Grid and get the images porportion.
