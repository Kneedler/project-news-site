# News Site

The assignment was to create a news site with some articles and a navbar by using grid or flexbos. I desided to focus on flexbox, and I based my news site on Lego.

## The problem
Code is a whole new world for me, so Ive had a hard time grasping it all. It's been a ride so to speak. I've had dificulties with the pictures, getting everyting to fit and to be inline. I've tried and faild many times, and I'm not sure i grasp it now eather or understand it all, but I'm happy with the results as it is my first time. If i had more time I would try out Grid and getting the images porpotion.
